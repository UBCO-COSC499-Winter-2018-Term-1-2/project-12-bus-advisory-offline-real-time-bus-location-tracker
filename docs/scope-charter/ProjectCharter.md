> 1\. BACKGROUND
> 
> 1.1. Problem Statement

Currently there is a ridership of 4.9 million in Kelowna per year, a
fair amount of riders (\>1%) use the transit app, with this app we are
looking to take a portion of the demand for maps and transit for this
app. Current apps have issues with real time because they are unreliably
crowdsourced, or just use the bus schedule for times. This causes people
missing busses, or having to wait for extended periods for the bus. This
wastes time for the average bus user, and promotes use of private
vehicles instead of bus use, impacting the environment negatively. This
app will make it easier to determine when one needs to leave for the
bus, by giving accurate bus times, promoting bus use and less of a
carbon footprint.

> 1.2. Scope Statement

The objective of the project is to create and launch an android app with
the following requirements by April of 2019. Requirements:

  - > connect to the beacons offline

  - > Use beacons to track a vehicle

  - > Use beacons to detect average arrival time

  - > Have a graphical user interface that shows a map

  - > Have a graphical user interface that shows a position of a chosen
    > bus

  - > Have a graphical user interface that shows the nearby bus
    > schedules with bus numbers and directions

  - > Be able to tap on bus number/direction and be able to track the
    > bus live offline

  - > Be able to receive notifications about soon to arrive busses that
    > are selected

  - > Be able to collect user data without collecting personal
    > information

  - > Connect to maps api online

  - > Get directions and show a graphical interface on how to get there

  - > App must be for android or ios

  - > Bus and directions search bar at top of the screen for gui

  - > User can use application without an account

  - 
> 1.3. Impact to Business and/or Stanford Community
> 
> \<This section should address the improved operations, efficiencies,
> cost savings and/or changes that will result from the proposed
> project. This section will help to alert Central Businesses and
> Distributed Users as to the extent and kinds of changes that will take
> place and should foster an understanding of upcoming change management
> necessary. Please be as specific as possible with respect to
> identification of the impacted user groups and the timing and nature
> of the change to their processes.\>
> 
> 1.4. Key Performance Indicators
> 
> \<List one or more KPI‚Äôs that allow the University to measure the
> operational efficiency, improved accuracy and/or effectiveness because
> of this project. An example is, ‚ÄúDecrease Average Turnaround Time per
> Invoice from 30 days to two weeks by EOY 2010.‚Äù The KPI is ‚ÄòDecrease
> Turnaround Time Per Invoice.'
> 
> If KPI‚Äôs cannot be defined then a list of success factors and/or
> benefits should be described in this section.\>
> 
> 1.5. Effects of Not Doing Project
> 
> \<This section should call out the impact of not completing the
> project
> 
> ¬∑ Use clear, business centric language to articulate the effect
> 
> ¬∑ Next effect\>
> 
> 2\. APPROACH
> 
> 2.1. Solution Overview
> 
> \<This section should communicate the high-level solution as proposed
> by this project charter. Further sections of this project will provide
> more detail.\>
> 
> 2.2. In-Scope
> 
> \<This section should clearly define the scope of the solution. A
> bulleted list with a brief description would be helpful.\>
> 
> 2.3. Impacts on / Touch Points with Other Systems
> 
> \<This section should identify the integrations with other systems
> inside and outside of AS / ITS. Be sure to address impacts on upstream
> and/or downstream systems, identify whether an integration needs to be
> built or whether the impacted system is indirectly impacted. This
> section is import to complete as it may also affect other staff
> resources who may not be called out explicitly on the project.\>
> 
> 2.4. Out-of-Scope
> 
> \<This section should clearly define what is outside the scope of the
> solution. A bulleted list with a brief description would be helpful.
> Description should answer why an item is not considered in-scope.\>

Success Criteria:

  - > The app will have simple and elegant user experience following
    > standard human computer interaction rules

  - > User satisfaction will be measured by a standardized set of
    > questions followed by the usability test and will measure 3 or
    > higher on a 5 point scale.

  - > The user interface will follow the best UI practices and ‚Äòmaterial
    > design‚Äô standards.

  - > The user interface will be similar to uber/google maps/transit
    > app.

  - > Response time should not be more than 2-3 seconds.

> 2.8. Assumptions and Constraints
> 
> Assumptions: the beacons given will work as expected; the api for the
> beacons works; the busses will follow the same route at all times; the
> beacons respond within a reasonable amount of 1-2 seconds; nobody will
> vandalize or steal the beacons
> 
> Constraints: using beacon technology; budget of $0; limited time and
> group size; limited amount of beacons to experiment with; not enough
> macs to develop for ios as well as android;
> 
> 2.9. Project Risks
> 
> \<Identify the assumptions that have a bearing on the project charter
> and that influenced your decisions in this document. Also include
> project risks and identify mitigation factors.\>

Methodology:

Scrumban- Trello

Weekly meeting- (Monday)sync up, demo, planning. If Monday doesn‚Äôt work
out for some reason, we will have meeting on Friday or Tuesday before
the class (not recommended)

1 week sprint

Backlog will be created in each week‚Äôs planning based on the progress
and priority.

Every week the developers will pick up the tasks from backlog they think
they can finish in that week. If a task seems big, sub tasks can be
created under that task. Everyone is expected to finish at least 80% of
their workload each week, although 100% is preferred. The rest can be
carried forward to the next week.

No need for daily scrum meeting as trello is synced to the scrum
channel. So everything knows who‚Äôs working on what.
